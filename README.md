 A simple rock paper scissors game I made to understand basics of python concepts such as variables , functions, lists ,etc .
 The program simply takes user input and randomly gives its own choice ,thus making this game fair and fun.
 Feel free to commit any changes and give suitable feedback and various points of improvement.
